# OcpChallenge

This is a starter Angular app for the OCP (Open Closed Principle) Coding challenge.

## The Open Closed Challenge

You’ll be implementing an employee taxation calculator. There will be three rounds. At the beginning of each round, you’ll receive new requirements to implement. In the first round, you have 30 minutes to implement the requirements. In the next rounds, you have 20 minutes. If you fail to deliver in the given time you drop out of the challenge :stuck_out_tongue: . You have to deliver each round of work in a single commit. A person with the least number of removed lines wins (`git log --shortstat` will be used).
Remember about OCP, don't care too much about the other rules - the time is ticking.
